# Ways to support my work

A collection of all the ways YOU can support the work I'm doing at the [Code For Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/c/Codeforyourself) YouTube channel. 

This work takes a lot of effort. I usually write scripts, record and edit videos deep into the night after a full day of work or on weekends. If you believe that these educational materials should be available **for free** and want to **support this work** you can find ways to do that below.
